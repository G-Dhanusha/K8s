# Kubernetes(k8s)

* K8s helps in running containers in production on scale.
* k8s uses clustering technology which is collection of nodes but it looks as if we are communicating withone endpoint.
* Desired State: Desired state is expressing what we want rather than how to create

Cluster: 

Cluster is collection of compute, storage and networking resources that  Kubernetes uses to run workloads.

Node: 

It is a single host. Now we can put the cluster as collection of nodes.

* Kubernetes has two kinds of Nodes
